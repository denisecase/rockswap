# Optional: Setup Locally (on your machine)

If you want to change gameplay, scoring logic, or transitions, you'll probably want to set up the project to run locally on your machine.

## Project Tools

| Tool           | What it does                                        | Why we use it                                                |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Node.js**    | Lets you run JavaScript apps locally.               | Needed for development tools.                                |
| **npm**        | Installs helper libraries listed in `package.json`. | Handles setup commands like `npm install` and `npm run dev`. |
| **TypeScript** | Adds type checking to JavaScript.                   | Catches simple mistakes early.                               |
| **Prettier**   | Formats code automatically.                         | Keeps files neat and consistent.                             |
| **Vite**       | Fast local web server and build tool.               | Reloads instantly as you edit.                               |
| **Git**        | Version control.                                    | Used for commits and syncing changes.                        |
| **VS Code**    | Developer-friendly editor.                          | Recommended for TypeScript projects.                         |
