## Periodically: Get Updates from the Original Repo

<summary>⚠️ Handling Merge Conflicts (Click to expand)</summary>

**Good news:** If you only edited `src/config.ts`, you should have **zero conflicts**!

If you do get conflicts:

1. Open the conflicted file
2. Look for sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Keep your changes (your custom colors)
4. Delete the conflict markers
5. Commit the resolved file

**Example conflict in config.ts:**

    <<<<<<< HEAD
    export const ROCK_COLORS = ["#ff0000", "#00ff00"];  // Your colors
    =======
    export const ROCK_COLORS = ["#blue", "#green"];     // Upstream colors
    >>>>>>> upstream/main

**Resolution:** Keep YOUR colors:

    export const ROCK_COLORS = ["#ff0000", "#00ff00"];  // Your colors

<summary>📝 Tips for Forkers (Click to expand)</summary>

### Keep It Simple:

- **Only edit `src/config.ts`** for colors and settings
- Avoid editing other files unless you know what you're doing
- This minimizes merge conflicts when getting updates

### Testing Colors:

- Use 5-6 colors for best gameplay (matching gets too easy with fewer, too hard with more)
- Test on mobile! Colors should be distinguishable on small screens
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes (use patterns too, eventually)

### Sharing Your Fork:

- Change the repo description to mention it's a custom version
- Link back to the original repo: Based on RockSwap (original-link)
- Share your color scheme! Tag it #rockswap-custom

<summary>🆘 Troubleshooting (Click to expand)</summary>

### Game doesn't update after changes:

- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Check that GitHub Pages rebuilt (Settings → Pages shows deployment status)

### Colors not showing:

- Make sure you used valid hex codes: "#rrggbb"
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify `src/config.ts` was saved and committed

### Build fails on GitHub Pages:

- Check Actions tab for error messages
- Make sure `vite.config.ts` has correct `base:` path
- Ensure `package.json` has no syntax errors
