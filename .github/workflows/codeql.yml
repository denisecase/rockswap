# File: .github/workflows/codeql.yml
# Purpose: Security Scanning (GitHub CodeQL)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This workflow runs GitHub's built-in CodeQL scanner.
#
# It looks through the code and tries to detect security
# vulnerabilities, coding errors, and dependency issues.
#
# Think of it as a "digital safety inspection" that runs
# automatically each week and whenever code changes are pushed.
#
# CodeQL is maintained by GitHub and uses the latest scanner
# tools under the hood - no setup required.
