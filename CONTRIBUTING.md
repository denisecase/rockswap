# Contributing

Welcome! This project is for fun - you can play, learn, and help make it better.

You **don't need to install anything** to explore or make small changes.
You can edit right in your browser on GitHub or open it instantly in **`.dev`** (the GitHub web IDE).
Automatic actions will check, build, and publish updates when you commit or open a pull request.

To **run or test the game locally**, see setup instructions below.

## Try Editing

- **Want to change rock colors?** Edit `src/systems/renderer.ts`.
- **Want to web page colors?** Edit `index.css`.

Each code file is small and commented. Read the header lines for guidance.

## For Bigger Changes (Optional Local Setup)

If you want to change gameplay, scoring logic, or transitions, you'll probably want to set up the project locally. See [SETUP](./SETUP.md).
